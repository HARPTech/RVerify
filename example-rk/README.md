Optimized Regulation Kernel
===========================

This regulation kernel is an optimised version of the most simplistic 
approach to controlling the wheels of the rover.

Requirements
------------

To run this code, RBase needs to be installed and the `RRegistry` and `RSupport` python 
modules must be in the `PYTHONPATH`. This environment is given automatically when
running the regulation kernel inside using [RTest](https://github.com/HARPTech/RTest).
